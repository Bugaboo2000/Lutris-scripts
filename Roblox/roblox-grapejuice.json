On Arch Linux derivates, install lib32-libpulse\r\n\r\nError on line 5, missing setuptools\r\n\r\nOn Arch Linux derivates, you need to install python-setuptools\r\n\r\nIncreasing Performance  \r\n\r\nBy default, grapejuice selects the Api according to your hardware, but if you are experiencing issues you to run, you can change to Opengl or Vulkan. To do that open grapejuice, Player, Graphics Settings, Roblox Renderer, and switch the api of your choice.\r\n\r\nYou can also use Esync and Fsync going to \"user_settings.json\" located in the folder ~/.config/brinkerviii/grapejuice/ and adding these parameters inside the \"env\" brackets:\r\n\r\n\"WINEESYNC\": \"1\",\r\n\"WINEFSYNC\": \"1\"",
