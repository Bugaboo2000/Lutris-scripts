# About

This is my fork of grapejuice maded to work together with Lutris installer and make easier to install with some useful scripts 

 ## Installing with Lutris

 Download and install the dependencies:

~~~
 curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bugaboo2000/Lutris-scripts/master/Roblox/depends.sh -o depends.sh
~~~

Give executable permissions:

~~~
chmod +x depends.sh
~~~

Execute the script:

~~~
./install.sh
~~~

Install wine:

Before you do anything with Grapejuice, you need to have Wine installed. Roblox will only work if you have wine-staging 8.0 or higher installed on your system. If your distribution does not have the required Wine version, its recommended to install Wine Staging from the official WineHQ website. if you do not want to install another version of Wine globally, you can check out the guide on using custom Wine builds.
[WineHQ download page for Debian](https://wiki.winehq.org/Debian)
