## ðŸš€ Installing Grapejuice

 - ðŸ“¦ Grapejuice can be installed from the package or from the source code.
 - ðŸš€ It's recommended that you install Grapejuice from the package if possible.
 - ðŸŒ± If there's no package for your distribution or you're developing Grapejuice, install from source.

Alternatively, if you are on a system with Flatpak, you can click [here](https://dl.flathub.org/repo/appstream/net.brinkervii.grapejuice.flatpakref) to download Grapejuice with all the necessary components already set up to run Roblox. You can also click [here](https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.brinkervii.grapejuice) to view the Flathub page. The guide to install via the flatpak can be found [here](Installing-from-flatpak). The Flatpak may be useful if you have trouble with building from source or with using your distro's package.
