This document will guide you through the steps of installing Grapejuice on Fedora. Please read it in its entirety, from top to bottom.

## Installation options

The follwing Grapejuice installation methods can be used to install Grapejuice on Fedora:
- Flatpak
- Source Installation

It is recommended you use the **Flatpak** method for Fedora. **Do not** install both multiple at the same time. Doing so will cause conflicts in your system. If you are not sure which method to use, stick to the recommended option.

If, for some obscure reason, the Flatpak version of Grapejuice does not work on your system, you can uninstall the Flatpak and try the source method.

## Install Grapejuice using Flatpak
<FlatpakReference />

## Install Wine
<WinePreamble distroId="Fedora" distroName="Fedora" />

## Installing Grapejuice from source
<Tip type="danger">
    This method is not recommended for your Distribution. Do not run these commands if you do not know what you are doing!
</Tip>

First, make sure your system is fully up to date. Following that, install the dependencies required by Grapejuice:
```sh
sudo dnf install gettext git python3-devel python3-pip python3-virtualenv cairo-devel gobject-introspection-devel cairo-gobject-devel make xdg-utils glx-utils
```

To install Grapejuice from source, you actually need the source first. Download the source code by running this command:
```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://gitlab.com/brinkervii/grapejuice.git /tmp/grapejuice
```

When the git clone command has finished, you can actually install Grapejuice by running these commands:
```sh
cd /tmp/grapejuice
./install.py
```
