This document will guide you through the steps of installing Grapejuice on OpenSUSE. Please read it in its entirety, from top to bottom.

## Installation options

The follwing Grapejuice installation methods can be used to install Grapejuice on OpenSUSE:
- Flatpak
- Source Installation

It is recommended you use the **Flatpak** method for OpenSUSE. **Do not** install both multiple at the same time. Doing so will cause conflicts in your system. If you are not sure which method to use, stick to the recommended option.

If, for some obscure reason, the Flatpak version of Grapejuice does not work on your system, you can uninstall the Flatpak and try the source method.

## Install Wine
You need Wine in order to play Roblox. For OpenSUSE we recommended you follow the instructions on the SUSE wiki.

## Installing Grapejuice from source
<Tip type="danger">
    This method is not recommended for your Distribution. Do not run these commands if you do not know what you are doing!
</Tip>

First, make sure your system is fully up to date. Following that, install the dependencies required by Grapejuice:
```sh
sudo zypper install gettext-runtime git python3-devel python3-pip python3-virtualenv cairo-devel gobject-introspection-devel make xdg-utils gtk3-devel python3-gobject-Gdk
```

To install Grapejuice from source, you actually need the source first. Download the source code by running this command:
```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://gitlab.com/brinkervii/grapejuice.git /tmp/grapejuice
```

When the git clone command has finished, you can actually install Grapejuice by running these commands:
```sh
cd /tmp/grapejuice
./install.py
```
