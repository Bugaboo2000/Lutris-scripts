## Installation options

The follwing Grapejuice installation methods can be used to install Grapejuice on Linux Mint:
- Source Installation
- Package
- Flatpak

It is recommended you use the **Flatpak** method for Linux Mint. **Do not** install both multiple at the same time. Doing so will cause conflicts in your system. If you are not sure which method to use, stick to the recommended option.
