Make sure that your system is up to date and that it is set up to use the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/). It is recommended that you use an [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers) to install the Grapejuice package.

There are two variants of the package. A versioned package and a VCS package. The versioned package is called `grapejuice` and the VCS package is called `grapejuice-git`. Be aware that you have to update `grapejuice-git` manually.

Install the `grapejuice` package using your AUR helper of choice.
