# Grapejuice

Roblox works quite well with Wine, though there are some minor issues running it. Grapejuice fills in the
gaps around these issues, so you can experience Roblox to its fullest on your favourite Linux distribution.

The primary gap-filler feature is the fact that Wine by default creates no protocol handlers, which is how Roblox
functions at its core. Without protocol handling, you won't be able to launch Roblox Studio and Experiences from the
website!

Note that Grapejuice is unofficial software. This is not officially supported by Roblox.
